# XSS-scanner

## Overview
The Smart Contract XSS Detector is a cutting-edge security tool designed to identify and mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in smart contracts. This project aims to ensure the security and integrity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Algorand  blockchain.

Some of the main technologies used in the project include Python and JavaScript programming languages, along with the Algorand SDK for interacting with the blockchain. We equally used vulnDb api for the vulnerability assesment.
